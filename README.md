# Diabetes-Classification
## Diabetes
In this dataset you have 3 different outputs:
1. No readmission;
2. A readmission in less than 30 days (this situation is not good, because maybe
your treatment was not appropriate);
3. A readmission in more than 30 days (this one is not so good as well the last
one, however, the reason could be the state of the patient.

## The task is either to classify a patient-hospital outcome or to cluster them aiming at finding patterns that give a distinct insight.

## MODEL RESULT
In this solution I applied AutoML solution from Azure to experiment and deliver a model in short time
We include the analysis and results (not so good) of the classification, but the imbalanced data in the target variable and another works with some variables need more advanced intervention from the best practices and optimization to improve the Accuracy and recall
